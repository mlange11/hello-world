# hello-world
Just another repository

- I'm a beginning computer programmer with some experience with C.
- I've also read a little bit about java and C++.
- Technology has always been very intriguing to me, and I'm excited to have the opportunity
  to learn about it/learn to program computers.
- I just got a job in a physics lab where I will be doing some programming in C++ and python.
- I'm looking forward to working in the lab, gaining experience, and growing in knowledge about technology/programming/
physics.
